        The expression for \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ given in the literature 
        {see, e.g. Eq. (I-7) in \cite FaggHanna1959} use Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients, but GSL
        only provides Wigner-3j symbols.
        The CG coefficients include an additional factor of {see, e.g., Eq. (C.12) in \cite Messiah19922}

        \f[
            \left( -1 \right)^{-L + L^\prime - M} \sqrt{2 \nu + 1},
        \f]

        where \f$M\f$ denotes the total magnetic quantum number.
        In the present case, all factors cancel out, and the Wigner-3j symbols can be used.
        Note, however, that \f$M\f$ changes its sign when going from the CG coefficient 
        to the Wigner-3j symbol.
